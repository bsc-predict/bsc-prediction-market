<h2 class="text-2xl underline">More paused markets</h2>

<br/>
<a class="underline" href="https://www.bscpredict.com/blog/2021-10-23">Last week</a> I spoke about how resilient the prediction games have been and that week's pause was the first one in over a month. Well, about that (red marks paused markets)...

The markets were pretty much non-functional for much of the week. This had to do with overall binance smart chain market congestion and issues with The Graph so I can't blame the PancakeSwap team. I do wish the team officially paused the markets rather than letting them stall out though. The `executeRound` function locks in the final price for a round. If it hasn't been called called by the `closeTimestamp` time, the round is officially cancelled and the game needs to be restarted. But the operator still has to call `pause` on the contract for the game to be officially paused on the app.

<br/><br/>

When the games re-opened we saw sparse volume, but that seems to have picked up by Monday morning.

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Winners and losers</h2>

<br/>
Some people have a deep bankroll or they're just gluttons for pain. Our friend from <a class="underline" href="https://www.bscpredict.com/blog/2021-10-23">last week</a>, <a class="underline" href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xc8923536f8c1a348f15e87315740bb5933aeb4c9">0xc8923536f8c1a348f15e87315740bb5933aeb4c9</a>, just can't seem to give up the games. He had one of the biggest losses of the week in <strong>round 16216</strong>. He bet <strong>46.13</strong>. As usual, people piled in on the other side of the bet to even out the odds, but that still didn't help since he ende up you blowing <strong>~$23,000</strong> in 5 minutes. Don't do this.

`0xc89` actually had number 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 of our biggest losers this week. Honorable mention to <a class="underline" href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x3e4ab47e0fa186fce56b41da86b7bba730941755">0x3e4ab47e0fa186fce56b41da86b7bba730941755</a> who blew <strong>30 BNB</strong> on round 16181. He only played 43 games but went through <strong>109 BNB</strong> or <strong>~$58,000</strong>. He's since <a class="underline" href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x3e4ab47e0fa186fce56b41da86b7bba730941755">emptied out</a> his account for the most part.



<br/><br/>
It's actually encouraging when I see people make large bets and odds more or less even out. That means there are a lot of people sitting on the side-line waiting for these opportunities. And it helps the whales since they get better odds. Although betting such large amounts into a shallow pool is still not advisable.

<br/><br/>

As for the winners, <a class="underline" href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xf133bc440526f54dbc10cb2510ceb79e5cf6a1c4">0xf133bc440526f54dbc10cb2510ceb79e5cf6a1c4</a> has a hell of a tear. In 80 games, he won <strong>77.1 BNB</strong> with large bet sizes.

His strategy is to bump the bet size on losses so he makes up for his losses with his wins. This is known as the <a class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)">Martingale betting system</a>. It could theoretically work but practically you're not able to double your bet size indefinitely as you'll eventually go broke. Also don't do this.

<br/><br/>
I would actually love to interview some of these people. It could be anonymous but I would like to get some insight in different betting strategies and personal stories from people playing. If anyone would like to talk <a class="underline" href="mailto:contact@bscpredict.com">reach out</a> to me and I can feature you on future posts.

<br/><br/>

That's it for this week, but I'm excited that the markets are back and volume is picking back up.
