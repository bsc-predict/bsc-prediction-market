I love playing BSC prediction markets but I don't love the  <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/predictions" class="underline">Pancake Swap interface</a>.

<br/>

If you're using an account that has a long bet history, you'll notice that the default app is almost unusable. The format is terrible for analysis and the refresh is too infrequent. So I built <a class="underline" href="/">BSC Predict</a> to address these problems.

<br/>

The main improvement I hope to make over <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/predictions" class="underline">Pancake Swap Prediction Markets</a> is playability and tools for analysis. BSC Predict the same <a class="underline" href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x516ffd7d1e0ca40b1879935b2de87cb20fc1124b">contract</a> so you'll have the same depth and payoff as you do when playing on Pancake Swap. BSC Predict does not take a cut, and I am unaffiliated with Pancake Swap.

BSC Predict is <a href="https://github.com/bsc-predict/bsc-prediction-market" class="underline">open source</a>.

<br/>

Not only that, but <a href="https://github.com/bsc-predict/bsc-predict-updater/blob/master/data/v2/main/rounds.csv" class="underline">all round</a> data is available in csv format for analysis. It gets updated every minute or so its up to date. In future blog posts I hope to go over analysis and strategy.

Whenever you use any defi service, it's important to know what contract you're interacting with. You can do that by reviewing <a href="https://github.com/bsc-predict/bsc-prediction-market/blob/master/src/contracts/prediction.ts#L6" class="underline">the source</a> and looking at the <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x18B2A687610328590Bc8F2e5fEdDe3b582A49cdA" class="underline">contract</a> from Meta Mask when you call a transaction. Make sure its <code>0x18B2A687610328590Bc8F2e5fEdDe3b582A49cdA</code>
