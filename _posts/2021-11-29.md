<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Another volatile week</h2>
<br/>

We had another volatile week in crypto. BNB started in the h500s, dropped as low as m500s briefly touched m600s, only to come back down and end the week in mh500s. All-in-all BNB fared relatively well compared to other crypto. Bitcoin started the week out at nearly $60k and ended in lm50s, for a total drop of nearly 10%.

<br/><br/>

I won't pretend to know what's driving crypto prices, but as always I'll remind everyone to regularly take profits from the game or at least diversify.

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">More stoppages</h2>

<br/>

This won't come as a surprise to any regular reader of this blog, but we saw a number of stoppages this week. We saw a total of 5 stoppages although they were short and quickly resolved.
<br/><br/>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Epoch</td><td>Start Time</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>22605</td><td>2021-11-23 08:04:09</td></tr>
    <tr><td>22606</td><td>2021-11-23 09:28:48</td></tr>
    <tr><td>22607</td><td>2021-11-23 10:48:03</td></tr>
    <tr><td>22612</td><td>2021-11-23 22:28:24</td></tr>
    <tr><td>22751</td><td>2021-11-24 20:46:45</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

At least they're trying to get it back up quickly.

<br/><br/>

I mentioned last time but stoppages are annoying but they're usually followed by light volume, which is both a risk and opportunity. If you're building a bot that trades, you may want to consider stoppages and hold back because you might be betting into an shallow pool, hurting your payout. On the other hand, there may be opportunity as others bet into a shallow pool

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Thanksgiving turkey</h2>

<br/>

We had some very large rounds this week in terms of size. The largest rounds were on 2021-11-25 (Thanksgiving in the US), although they would be late night Wednesday or very early Thursday depending on the timezone. My theory is someone was home for Thanksgiving the night before and threw down some stacks. Maybe he was flexing to his former high-school friends.

<br/>
Either way, here are the biggest rounds of the week


<table class="table">

    <tr><td>Epoch</td><td>Timestamp</td><td>UTC Time</td><td>Total amount BNB</td></tr>

<br/><br/>

A good chunk of of the volume came from account <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x7324b637f95691c652859deaa733f4d5c3f67103" class="underline">0x7324b637f95691c652859deaa733f4d5c3f67103</a>. This year I am grateful for those that throw down large helping us little folks just trying to edge out the 3% house take. For that we over at BSC Predict salute you.

You may recognize the top winner of the week, as our friend 0xc89, who showed up in our <a href="http://localhost:3003/blog/2021-10-23" class="underline">2021-10-23</a>, <a href="http://localhost:3003/blog/2021-11-01" class="underline">2021-11-01</a> and <a href="http://localhost:3003/blog/2021-11-08" class="underline">2021-11-08</a> recaps, usually on the wrong side of winners and losers, although he was #2 on the winner board on 2021-11-08 recap. 

<br/><br/>

Well, this week he reclaims the winner throne with a staggering performance of winning 89 BNB. It goes to show you persistence pays off. Swing for the fences, eventually you'll get there. How is his performance in total?

<br/><br/>

<br/>

Turns out he's down over $350k. Do <strong>not</strong> do whatever he does.

<br/><br/>

My dream is to interview this guy, so if anyone knows how I can get in contact with him, drop me an <a href="mailto:contact@bscpredict.com" class="underline">email</a>.

<br/><br/>
Which brings us to our losers.

No surprises here. Our Thanksgiving turkey topped the list with a total loss of ~$100k. Special shoutout to 0xc503 who managed to make our list with only 5 bets in a very short period of time.
