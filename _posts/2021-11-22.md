All of the round data referenced below can be downloaded from <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/bsc-predict/bsc-predict-updater/tree/master/data/v2/main">here</a>. The data is part of a project that downloads round data periodically and uploads the csv.

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Rough week</h2>
<br/>

We had a run up in crypto over the last two weeks with BNB entering November are around $530 only to rise to over $650, before coming down a bit to low-600s end of last week. This week we saw the price drop considerably, to as low as low $500s, but it came back up towards the end of the week and ended in the high $500s.

<br/><br/>

It's always tough to watch as you see your balance dropping due to no fault of your own. It's just a reminder that you should limit your exposure to any one crypto. Even if you're doing well on prediction markets, you should regularly cash out.


<br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">The (shit) Graph</h2>

<br/>

We've also seen issues with <a href="https://thegraph.com/en/" class="underline">The Graph</a> which PancakeSwap (and until recently BSC Predict) uses to an extent. Its a service that lets you query prediction data, such as individual rounds and all the bettors on those rounds. It's been on and off for a while and almost always well behind live data, but it just stopped reporting anything this week. You can see (at time of writing) <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/prediction/leaderboard" class="underline">PancakeSwap leaderboard</a> just spins out indefinitely .

<br/>
I was using The Graph for BSC Predict history page, but I moved that away, so it should be working now.

<br/><br/>

It's a bit frustrating considering how popular prediction markets have been. I had a <a href="https://www.bscpredict.com/blog/2021-11-19" class="underline">post</a> on it this week, and long story short, PancakeSwap brings in around <strong>$3.5 million a month</strong> from predictions alone. I can't imagine how much they bring in for the other shit they really seem to be pushing. I don't understand why they wouldn't just invest in building out a proper backend to aggregate and query bet data. On the other hand, if they had a functional site, BSC Predict probably wouldn't be a thing.

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Stoppages</h2>

<br/>

Adding to the shit-show with The Graph, we had a number of stoppages in predictions this week. It's honestly quite embarrassing at this point.

<br/>

Volumes were a bit down from last week but nothing dramatic, although the 24-rolling pool size was well below 30 for much of the week (red lines are paused markets).

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Record Setting Payoff (sort of)</h2>
<br/>
One good thing about this week was a record setting payoff on <strong>epoch 21022</strong>  with the winning  bulls paying 54x return. If that epoch looks familiar, it's because it was one after 21021, which was paused. The bull and bear amounts were only 0.064 BNB and 3.56 BNB, respectively. However, all three transactions errored out and no one won or lost.

<br/><br/>

It's interesting to note though that rounds immediately following paused markets tend to be very light volume. That's bad if you're looking to push weight, but its good in case someone else puts down a large bet and you're able to take the other side with a relatively small bet and get a crazy payout. But that means being vigilant when the market is paused and anticipating the action.

<br/><br/>

Now on to everyone's favorite part, this week's winners and losers.

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Winners and Losers</h2>

<br/>

I thought last week was impressive, with <strong>0xa5d</strong> had an impressive run of 55.95 BNB in a single week, but this week, we had a <strong>0x219</strong> blow him out of the water with a run of <strong>74.18 BNB</strong> or <strong>~$42k</strong> in a single week.

Of course the bet sizes were out of control. <strong>0x219</strong> had a few good rounds but it was just reckless in my opinion. But hey, at least he knows when to cash out, to a ... checks notes ... <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x74d192e8b2eea128bff8bd6582d1189acfe8f459" class="underline">account</a> that has $360k in BNB. Okay this guy knows what he's doing...

As always, we have to give it up to our losers, and this week had its fare share. Our biggest loser topped last week with a total loss of <strong>280 BNB</strong> or <strong>~$160k</strong>

<strong>0x63b</strong> is an unsung hero as he has donated over <strong>317 BNB</strong> to the games. His wild bet sizes and terrible timing help drive payouts and allow even the least sophisticated player throw down on some whacky odds and occasionally come out ahead. For that, we at BSC Predict salute you.

That's it for this week. I'm still working on releasing a python trading bot, so look out for the in the next few weeks.
