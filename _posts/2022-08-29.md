<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Bitboy drama</h2>
This week's drama in crypto-land was surrounding Ben Armstrong or Bitboy. I don't follow any "crypto influencers" and haven't heard of Bitboy before a few weeks ago, but he made waves by suing someone for ... calling him a dirt bag? 

<br/><br/>

I don't follow crypto influencers because they're all pretty much scammers. At least with the female crypto influencers, they're selling their looks. But why would I care what some overweight neckbeard thinks about crypto? Is he a crypto developer or someone who made money with a strategy other than hodling from 2012? No? Then his opinion is meaningless to me 
<br/><br/>
The problem with crypto influencers is that the incentive for fuckery is just too high, especially if you're non-technical. Someone out a white paper and a landing page for a new crypto project, offers some influencers worthless coins to promote and the influencer just sees it as free money. There is little due diligence by the influencer and even if they tried, if they're non-technical it would be pretty much impossible to find the rug pull. The rug pull doesn't even have to be malicious. It could just be the owners dumping all their coins.
<br/><br/>
Anyway, ZachXBT discovered Bitboys pricing and practices by posing as someone looking to advertise. 
<br/><br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Letâ€™s review all the direct scams Bitboy has worked with in the past. Just in case you forgot here is the flyer with how much he charges. <br><br>I received this a while back by posing as a project interested in a promotion.<br>ðŸ§µ ðŸ‘‡ <a href="https://t.co/FkC9HUDGsc">pic.twitter.com/FkC9HUDGsc</a></p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1478082010807742468?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

<br/><br/>
Yeah, it's pretty bad, but it gets worse. ZachXBT also uncovered a bunch of explicit scams Bitboy promoted. It's not so each to track down because Bitboy has a habit of deleting videos of himself shilling certain coins or NFTs after the rug pull.

<br/><br/>
So this obviously wasn't good for Bitboy's business so Bitboy sued someone else claiming defamation.

<br/><br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wish I didnâ€™t have to make this thread.<br><br>But Iâ€™m being sued by the YouTuber Bitboy Crypto for a video I made roughly 9 months ago, covering how he promoted a project named PAMP.<br><br>Last night the 3rd person Bitboy sent to my house showed up and served me the lawsuit. <br>1/5</p>&mdash; atozy (@atozy) <a href="https://twitter.com/atozy/status/1562206338293309440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
<br/><br/>
Getting hit with a lawsuit is terrifying and if someone gets a reputation of suing people, you can bet it'll scare off many people trying to expose the person. Crypto has a huge problem with scams, so we need more digital sleuths uncovering frauds and less crypto influencers shilling shitcoins for money.  
<br/><br/>

This action resonated with a lot of people in the crypto community and atozy was able to crowd fund a few hundred thousand for a legal defense. Special shout-out to <a href="https://twitter.com/cobie" class="underline">Cobie</a> who donated $100k in ETH and another $100k when Bitboy lied about pulling the lawsuit. 
<br/><br/>
The response was so strong and Bitboy got so much shit online that Bitboy eventually claimed he'll pull the lawsuit, although there was a little "miscommunication" between his lawyers and himself, so who knows. But this was a rare win for the crypto community. Unfortunately Bitboy continue to have 1.44 million YouTube subscribers and closing in on a million Twitter followers. I would say he's probably no worse than any other sleazy crypto influencers, but he did try to sue someone for calling him out, so he really is worse. 

<br/><br/>
My advice for everyone interested in crypto is stay away from these people. Don't buy shitcoins and don't think of NFTs as investments. If you like to own or trade them or you want to support some team, that's fine. But if you're buying something on the expectation that it'll go up because some random neckbeard with a YouTube channel is telling you its hot, stay away. They're all shills.

<br/><br/>

<H2 class="text-2xl underline">Action</h2>

Volumes have somewhat stabalized. The only problem is they've stabalized at around 20 BNB per round

This is obviously pretty bad and no one in Pancake Swap seems to care.

In other news, crypto prices have taken a hit this week. There are rumors that MtGox Bitcoin will be dumped soon, but I haven't been able to confirm. I'm not sure if that's built in to the price, but normally these types of events get priced in pretty early and by the time it happens there's a pop because people are buying back. But who knows?

Top dog had a few good games this week. Our #2 was a top loser last week, losing ~35 BNB. Looks like he made it all back and then some! Good thing he didn't listen to me and stop playing otherwise he wouldn't... be down 1,385 BNB over his life? Okay nevermind...
