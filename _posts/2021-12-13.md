<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Official BSC Predict Starter Bot written in Python</h2>

<br/>

I'm excited to announce the release of the official <a href="https://github.com/bsc-predict/bsc-predict-bot" class="underline">BSC Predict Starter Bot</a>. I won't go into it too much here because I have another <a class="underline" href="https://www.bscpredict.com/blog/2021-12-12">blog post</a> about it.

<br/>

I know a lot of people that are interested in trying out a strategy but they may not be strong programmers or familiar enough with blockchain technology. This starter code will let them just jump right in and just focus on strategy.

<br/>

Check out the <a class="underline" href="https://www.bscpredict.com/blog/2021-12-12">blog post</a> for more details.

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Crypto Prices and Stoppages</h2>

<br/>
Crypto prices recovered mid week only to fall again towards the end of the week. At the time of writing, BNB is around mid-500s, not a value any of us want to see, but I remember BNB hitting low-300s just three months ago.

<br/><br/>

This week was the first in a long time with no stoppages, although volumes were not very high. 24-hour rolling volumes were hovering around 25 for much of the week, slightly lower than last week and well below October and November levels. I think it's likely tied to the price of BNB. When people have more in terms of fiat, they feel rich so they naturally go to the casino.

<br/><br/>

Although we didn't have any stoppages, we did see network issues on 2021-12-07 with several round sizes dropping to less than 1 BNB. We even had a ridiculous payout on round 25825 (2021-12-07 09:18:10) of 105.5x. Here are the bets that managed to get through in that round:

Not a bad payout for a $7 bet. Which brings us to...

Our top player of the week is 0x41c, making a repeat appearance on the winner board from <a class="underline" href="">last week</a>. He was #8 last week with a total haul of nearly 32 BNB. Looks like he's firmed up his across 227 bets. Looks like he's firmed up his strategy this week and pulled in 98.62 BNB.

<br/><br/>

0x712f (#2) also makes a second appearance from 2021-11-29 post.

<br/>
0x7f9f (#5) is another regular and is making his fourth appearance on the market report. Everyone else is fresh blood.

<br/><br/>

Now onto our losers.

It never ceases to amaze me how much money people throw around in these games. Hats off to 0x168e. His bet size was large but not comically so. He just went hard and didn't back down.


<br/><br/>

The interesting this is that he did about as bad as he could possibly have done, a truly remarkable feat. If you look at his max drawdown, which tells us theoretically how much he could have lost if he started and stopped playing at the worst possible points, you'll see he was only just above it (-265 vs -244)!

Truly a string of bad luck. And for that, we at BSC Predict salute him.
