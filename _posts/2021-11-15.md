<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Another great week</h2>

<br/>BSC Predict saw another great week with only one brief stoppage. BNB was able to sustain its price level of low-mid 600s to mid 600s and crypto in general was flat week over week. Considering the run up of the last few weeks, no news is good news.
<br/><br/>

Volumes on BSC Predict came down a bit from the last week but picked back up on the weekend. We were looking at a 24-hour rolling average pool size between 35 and 25 for most of the week.
<br/><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Payoffs</h2>

Last week during the bull run, betting BULL led to slightly higher performance with the BULLs taking 53% of epochs. This week we were a lot more even with BULLs taking only 49.4% of epochs.
<br/><br/>

We didn't have any crazy payoffs. The biggest payoff of this week was epoch 18839 with a winning payoff of 7.3. Last week we saw a few large payoffs. 17651 (23.95x), epoch 18205 (10.45x) and epoch 16963 (7.85x).
<br/><br/>


<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Winners and Losers</h2>

We  had some truly incredible runs with 0xa5d pulling in nearly 56 BNB in a single week:

<br/><br/>

0xbd1 was interesting since he obviously did very well this week, but it was all due to his varying bet sizes. He has a couple of well placed large bets.
<br/><br/>If you haven't read my post last week on <a class="underline" href="https://www.bscpredict.com/blog/strategy-martingale">Martingale Strategy</a>, have a look. Sizing your bets should not be done naively.
<br/><br/>

Over at BSC predict, we love our losers, so let's give homage to those that have fallen:

Special shout-out to to 0xf133 for going hard as a mf with the big bet sizes.

Guy blew through 77 BNB in less than 30 minutes. But at least he knew when to pull out.

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Announcements</h2>
<br/>

I mentioned it last week, but I'll mention it again. In the next few weeks I'll release some starter code to run your own trading bot. It'll be run locally on host computer. Remember to <strong>never</strong> give your private keys out to anyone.


<br/><br/>

And as always, I'm open to interviewing people anonymously via email about their strategy and trading setup. You don't have to be a top performer or anything. <a class="underline" href="mailto:contact@bscpredict.com">Email me</a> if you're interested.

<br/><br/>

That's it for this week. As always, feel free to <a class="underline" href="mailto:contact@bscpredict.com">reach out</a> with questions or comments or want my to highlight anything different on my weekly market recaps. If you like what you read and want to subscribe to receive an email when a new post is published, <a class="underline" href="https://forms.zoho.com/contact631/form/BSCPredictMailingList">click here</a>.
