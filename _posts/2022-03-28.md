<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Get your crypto off exchanges... again</h2>

Yeah, I know. I've written about this before buts it worth remembering that exchanges are not your friend. They're a net positive in my opinion but will comply with almost all orders from the state. Recently Coinbase has informed Canadian customers that you need written permission when sending crypto above a certain requirement.

I can't blame them really. It's a legal requirement and they have to pick their battles. But please, pick a battle and fight for it. It doesn't have to be this one, but we need a voice against shit like this. In the mean time, use exchanges to convert to and from fiat, but then do your homework and figure out how to self custody. Don't play along with this bullshit. Get your money off exchanges and go about your business as you see fit. 

<br/><br/>

Crypto has been doing well price wise and the regular twitter talking heads will post mystic tweets like "If you're surprised the price of crypto is going up, you haven't been paying attention". Never mind the same talking head was talking up the price as it was tanking. I would guess most of the price action was due to a few buyers sending in big orders. It's about supply and demand at this point.

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Action</h2>

We had a run-up in action early in the week and came off hard by the weekend.

Network issues? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't know. I haven't been playing much... A lot of people bowed out due to the increasing difficulty to grind out a positive return. Hopefully that changes with more volume or new games.

Pretty decent payouts. Nothing to write home about. A few boys on there which is nice to see. I noticed a lot of the bots are now cashing out more regularly to Binance hot wallet, which makes sense to cover your tracks, but may trigger a taxable event depending on your country.

Our top dog is appearing is making a repeat appearance from last week, where he lost a similar amount. His total losses are 260 BNB. Our #3 has made a number of appearances, often as a winner!  But he seems to have given most of it back in the second half of March and is now up only 17 BNB. Such is life. We love our losers.
