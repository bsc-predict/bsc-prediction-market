<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Crypto Twitter Shill List</h2>

Sometimes I feel like the crypto community is like a child that keeps disappointing you. You still love the little guy, and there's a lot of good work being done, but then there's also <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/leaked-shill-price-list-alleges-crypto-influencers-charge-up-to-usd-25000-for-a-shill-tweet.htm" class="underline">this</a>:

<br/><br>

<blockquote>
Zachxbt, an anonymous crypto researcher and self-proclaimed "on-chain sleuth," has published an extensive list of crypto influencers and how much they allegedly charge to "shill" crypto projects on Twitter
</blockquote>

<br/><br>

Here's the actual tweet:

<br/><br>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New influencer shill price list leak ðŸ“¸ <a href="https://t.co/l1MGgqfldv">pic.twitter.com/l1MGgqfldv</a></p>&mdash; zachxbt (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1516129830873583617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 


<br/><br>
I can't comment on the prices, because I don't follow this stuff closely. "How much is an effective shill worth" is kind of like asking "How many angels can dance on the head of a pin". I don't know! The prices seemed reasonable for the most part (few hundred dollars) but there was one outlier. None other than mean girl herself Lindsay Lohan is charging $25k for a shill and $20k for a retweet. 

<br/><br>
To be fair, she has 8.2 million followers (maybe the release of shill list juiced her followers). But compare that to someone like <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoWizardd" class="underline">CryptoWizardd</a> who charges $2k per shill. I only pick on the Wizard because I got a kick out of all the replies basically saying "et tu Wizard". The betrayal runs deep with this one.
<br/><br>

So the wizard is charging 2k for 293,600 or $0.0068 per follower, while Lohan is charging 25k for 8.2 million or $0.003 per follower. Lohan is a bargain! But the audience of the Wizard is obviously more concentrated in crypto. But on the other hand, I'm sure Wizard has a ton of bots following his account because, you know, its crypto. So who knows. Maybe Lohan's prices aren't unreasonable.

<br/><br>

I'm having some fun with this, but let's be real. Randos on crypto twitter are not your friends. They're shills. The absolute best case scenario is they're running a pump and dump with some of their own money invested. Worst case they're taking money from outright scams and have no skin in the game. Either way, they're sketchy af. The funny thing is we understand this when it comes to people like Cramer. If they knew anything they'd be trading and not shilling online.

<br/><br>

<br/><br>
At least crypto twitter shills are somewhat honest in that they don't pretend to rely on fundamentals. Next time you see a shill, just ask "what's unique about this shitcoin". No one would even pretend to have an answer apart from number go up.

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Action</h2>

Pretty big week! Volumes have shot back up and we even had one 100+ BNB round.

Another low earning week. Our top dog had a nice run but is new to the game but if you look at his winnings, you'll see most came in the end with a few very large well placed bets. He was betting 0.3 for most rounds and just amped it up to a bet size up to 20. It was a pathetic return too, only making 7.7 BNB on a 20 BNB bet size. A win is a win, but that's definitely not a risk I would be willing to take for a 1.4x return. My prediction is he won't stay on top for long.  Don't be like this guy.

Two 100+ BNB losers this week! And one guy managed to do it in only 7 bets!

<br/><br/>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jJ4YIBF.png">

<br/><br/>
I think he just stopped playing because he ran out of money. He played a total of 122 rounds and blew it all on the last 7. Hell of a week if you ask me. He even bet in the 100+ BNB round, throwing in 35 BNB into the pot. I love seeing 100 BNB rounds. Anything can happen. It's rarely ever organic and is almost always a single player throwing in 20+ BNB. In this scenario, it's a solid bet to go in (SMALL) on the underdog. Because obviously the person throwing down large is moving the odds, so may as well use that to your advantage. In this case that strategy would have netted you a 2.2x return. Not crazy but relatively safe if you ask me.

<br/><br/>
Anyway, sending love to all our losers. Hang in there.
