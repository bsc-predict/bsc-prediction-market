Today I'm going to do something a little different. I'm going to talk about <a class="underline" href="https://pancakeswap.finance/lottery">PancakeSwap Lottery</a> and check out their big winners and losers.
<br/><br/>

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Pancake Swap Lottery</h2>

<br/>

PancakeSwap Lottery works like any other lottery. You buy a ticket, get a number and a number is drawn. Depending on how many digits your number matches, you get a payout.

<br/>
Numbers are matched left to right. So for instance if your number is <strong>112556</strong> and the winning number is <strong>132556</strong>, you win bracket 1 since both your numbers started with 1.

<br/><br/>

<table class="table">
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>ticket</td><td style="background-color:green">1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
    <tr><td>winner</td><td style="background-color:green">1</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bracket</td><td style="background-color:green">1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br/>
If you match the first 2, then you're in bracket 2. You can't be in more than 1 bracket.

<br/><br/>

<table class="table">
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>ticket</td><td style="background-color:green">1</td><td style="background-color:green">3</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
    <tr><td>winner</td><td style="background-color:green">1</td><td style="background-color:green">3</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bracket</td><td>-</td><td style="background-color:green">2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br/><br/>

Payouts are allocated as a percentage of the pool size as follows:

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr><td>Digits matched</td><td>Prize pool allocation</td>

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Matches first 1</td><td>2%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Matches first 2</td><td>3%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Matches first 3</td><td>5%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Matches first 4</td><td>10%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Matches first 5</td><td>20%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Matches all 6</td><td>40%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Burn Pool</td><td>20%</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br/>

Apparently PancakeSwap doesn't make any money off the lottery and just uses it to prop up their CAKE token.

<br/><br/>

By my count, there have been around 4 million tickets purchased and around 388,000 claims on those tickets for a win rate of around 9.7%. This makes sense because the odds of winning are 1 in 10 or 10%. And of course some people forget to claim. 

<br/><br/>

Matching all 6 numbers has only happened 3 times out of 330 lotteries on lottery id 12, 16 and 261. If no one matches a bracket, the pool rolls over to the next lottery. This makes sense as well since hitting all 6 numbers is about 1 in a million (10^6) and there have been 4 million games played. The expected number of people who hit all 6 is 4, but 3 is pretty close! It's interesting that two of them happened so early on though...

<br/><br/>

Now that you have some background, lets get to the winners and losers!

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2 class="text-2xl underline">Winners and Losers</h2>

<br/>
When I originally went into this, I figured the biggest absolute winner would be a hardcore player. It would reason that the more you play the more likely you are to win big. I'm not saying the person would have made money, but I figure there are people that bought 100k in tickets and happened to win 50k. 

<br/><br/>

For the guy with the highest winnings, that's what happened.

<br/><br/>

I mentioned earlier how only 3 times has anyone won the top bracket. Unsurprisingly, all 3 of those players are in the top 10 of all time winning.

<br/><br/>


The <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x599f512ecf711be5745fcb3f4bfc6e8cfdf17cc7" class="underline">top guy</a> looks like a regular player, having won about average (10%). He played 28k games, won 2.8k for a bounty of 82k CAKE. He had spent just over 10k cake for a payout of 8.21x. But his biggest win in bracket 5 put him in the number one spot. In fact, most of his winnings came from a single lottery!

<br/><br/>
Here are his top 3 winnings.
<br/><br/>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr><td>from</td><td>lottery id</td><td>bracket</td><td>price</td><td>won</td><tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>0x599f512ecf711be5745fcb3f4bfc6e8cfdf17cc7</td><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>0.35</td><td>77,686.57</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0x599f512ecf711be5745fcb3f4bfc6e8cfdf17cc7</td><td>16</td><td>3</td><td>0.35</td><td>924.84</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0x599f512ecf711be5745fcb3f4bfc6e8cfdf17cc7</td><td>16</td><td>3</td><td>0.35</td><td>924.84</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<br/><br/>

In total, he's played 2 lotteries, 15 and 16 and bought a total of 399 and 2,497 tickets, respectively. He bought them in batches of 100 (the max allowed). I would say its a little sus, but around 95% of his winnings came from one ticket. 



<br/><br/>

<a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x599f512ecf711be5745fcb3f4bfc6e8cfdf17cc7" class="underline">#2</a> on the list is a story I love. Dude bought 7 tickets for 1.9 CAKE, about $25, won 2 of them, came away with 52,000 CAKE or around $676,000, and walked away. The funny thing is he bought 2 tickets in lottery 12 (1 of which was his big win), then he took a break for a while. Then he bought 1 ticket in lottery 76, didn't win. Another one in lottery 85, won 0.23 or about his ticket price. Then another 3 in lottery 94, nothing. That's it.

<br/><br/>


This guy has to be the most chill person on PancakeSwap. First time playing winning huge on two tickets, then just walking away. He still owns the cake!

<br/><br/>

The rest of the people are stories similar to either extreme.

<br/><br/>

Because this is BSC Predict and we love our losers, let's give them some respect:

<br/><br/>

The losers aren't even particularly unlucky. The win-rate is what we'd expect, around 10%. They just happen to bet a lot. The top dude spent around $50k on tickets, and won $12.5k. It could be worse. The dude just likes to spend a lot on tickets. Everyone else is more or less the same story.


<br/><br/>

But the losers do grow the pot for everyone else. And for that, we salute you.


<br/><br/>

Take care and bet responsibly!
