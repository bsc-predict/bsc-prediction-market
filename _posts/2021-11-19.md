All of the round data referenced below can be downloaded from <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/bsc-predict/bsc-predict-updater/tree/master/data/v2/main">here</a>. The data is part of a project that downloads round data periodically and uploads the csv.

PancakeSwap predictions are obviously popular. They're the only game in town for defi-betting. Believe me, I looked. There are a few clones but they have near zero volume. Even <a href='https://www.augur.net/' class='underline'>Augur</a> has tiny volume. Check it out yourself, oh unless of course you live in the US in which case its blocked. So much for decentralized finance.

<br/><br/>

PancakeSwap predictions is a rare thing. Extremely popular from the beginning and continues to be popular today. PancakeSwap must be doing well, but how well?

<br/><br/>

As of 2021-11-19 the treasury fee collected on PancakeSwap prediction contract v2 <span class="text-green-500 text-2xl text-strong underline">19,574 BNB</span> or around <span class="text-green-500 text-2xl text-strong underline">$11 million</span> since inception (at a $560 BNB price). Not that v2 of the contract was release on 2021-08-25, or less than three months ago. They're making nearly <span class="text-green-500 text-2xl text-strong underline">~$3.5 million a month</span>. That's a hell of a profit for a beta version.

<br/><br/>

Their biggest treasury fees were with draws, which happened 48 times! That's only 0.2% of the time, but it's still something. In a draw, everyone loses and the treasury takes the entire pot. In the rounds that ended with a draw, PancakeSwap made <span class="text-2xl text-strong underline">664 BNB</span> or <span class="text-green-500 text-2xl text-strong underline">~$438,000</span>.
<br/><br/>

Running predictions has some expenses. Mostly hosting and calling the contract. To execute a round, it costs around $3.50 (no, <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0xf5b4c4e9e8fb4b0cc961197b6c512c66dcf55e01" class="underline">seriously</a>), there have been ~21,500 rounds so that's around $73,000. Hosting is insignificant.

<br/><br/>

I gladly contribute my share to the treasury fee, knowing that they consistently bring volume to the game. I wish they had a better website, but that's what BSC Predict is here for.
<br/><br/>

But they need to get their shit together when it comes to the games going down periodically, or issues with The Graph that make the leaderboard useless or outdated. Also think about lowering the treasury fee to encourage more people to play or at least extend the dollar to play more games.  

<br/><br/>

I think I'll start releasing the leaderboard in the next week or so. In the meantime, here's the updated leaderboard for 2021-11-19
